# LLM Model Evaluation for biases and capabilities to assess their readiness for usages in agricultural advisory services.
**What precisely does the evaluation measure? 
Answer: Claim that LLM is built for farmer's advisory services.**
**Do we have a strong agreement that this is a good way to measure any particular concept? Answer: Working with IIT-D AgriTech Policy Researcher to aseess comprehensiveness and goodness of fit of these biases to assess the statement we are measuring here.**


**To identify potential biases in agricultural advisory services, we need to consider various factors that can impact the effectiveness, fairness, and accessibility of these services. Here are several possible biases:**

1. Linguistic Bias
    -  Language Barriers: Many advisory services are provided in dominant languages like Hindi or English, which may not be understood by all farmers, especially those in rural areas where local dialects are prevalent.
    -  Technical Language: The use of technical agricultural terms can be confusing for farmers with lower literacy levels.
2. Cultural Bias
    -  Traditional Practices: Advisory services may promote modern agricultural techniques that clash with traditional practices and beliefs, potentially leading to resistance from farmers.
    -  Gender Bias: Women farmers often have less access to advisory services compared to their male counterparts due to cultural norms and restrictions.
3. Socioeconomic Bias
    -  Wealth Disparities: Wealthier farmers might have better access to private advisory services and can afford the technologies recommended, while poorer farmers might not.
    -  Digital Divide: Digital advisory services may not reach farmers who lack access to smartphones, internet, or digital literacy.
4. Geographic Bias
    -  Urban-Rural Divide: Farmers in remote or rural areas may receive less frequent and lower-quality advisory services compared to those in more accessible regions.
    -  Regional Bias: Advisory services might be tailored more towards regions with better-developed agricultural infrastructure, neglecting areas with unique challenges.
5. Technological Bias
    -  Access to Technology: Farmers without access to modern farming equipment or technology may not benefit fully from technology-driven advisory services.
    -  Bias in AI and LLMs: If LLMs are trained on data that does not adequately represent the diverse conditions of Indian agriculture, the recommendations might be skewed or irrelevant for many farmers.
6. Institutional Bias
    -  Policy Implementation: Government policies might favor certain crops or farming methods, leading to biased advisory services that do not cater to all farmers equally.
    -  Resource Allocation: Limited resources may lead to prioritizing certain regions or types of farming over others, impacting the quality and reach of advisory services.
7. Information Bias
    -  Outdated Information: Advisory services might rely on outdated or irrelevant data, leading to ineffective recommendations.
    -  Generic Advice: Providing generic rather than location-specific advice can reduce the relevance and effectiveness of the services.
8. Accessibility Bias
    -  Physical Access: Farmers in regions with poor infrastructure (roads, transportation) may find it hard to access in-person advisory services.
    -  Service Availability: Limited availability of extension agents or advisory services can result in unequal distribution of support.
9. Bias in Content Delivery
    -  Mode of Delivery: Preferences for certain modes of delivery (e.g., SMS, apps) might not suit all farmers, especially those less familiar with digital tools.
    -  Content Relevance: Advisory content may be biased towards high-yield commercial farming, overlooking sustainable or organic farming practices that might be more suitable for some regions.
